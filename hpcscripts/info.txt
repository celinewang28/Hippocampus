1. Contents of raycasting folder are different from the one currently on the repository (as of 29/06/2021). It differs in that the sh script no longer transfers back to the hippocampus drive from the hpc, because the transfer fails for some reason (might be due to some firewall).
The other folders perform batch processing for each object respectively.

2. checkdone_hpc.sh can be run on the hpc after your jobs are complete to check if any of the objects are missing (might happen when a job fails due to insufficient memory).

3. When processing is done on the hpc, the 'origin' field of the objects will reflect the directory of your hpc folders. name_change.m can be used to change the 'origin' field if desired, just make sure to check that the to_remove and to_replace variables are correct, and the directory that is cd'd to contains the files you wish to change.

4. After you transfer the done files from the hpc into a temporary folder on a workstation, move_download.sh can be used to transfer those files to the respective directories on the hippocampus drive.

It would be a good idea to check the .sh scripts before running, and make sure the directories, etc. are correct.
For vmpc and vmsv, if you wish to use the 100px or 500px vmpv for processing, then the 100px/500px vmpv should be transferred in the vmphpc.sh/vmshpc.sh scripts.
Accordingly, the files should be transferred to 100px or 500px folders (and not the 1px) in move_download.sh.
